# **IoTron-Busify**

IoTron-Busify is a modern IoT-powered system designed for school management, focusing on geospatial tracking of partner schools and vehicles. The system leverages Django, Django REST Framework, MongoEngine, and Leaflet.js to offer real-time data visualization and interaction.

---

## **Features**
### **1. Partner School Management**
- Add and manage school data with geospatial information (coordinates and addresses).
- Dynamically display schools on an interactive map.
- Fetch school details through RESTful APIs.

### **2. Geospatial Mapping**
- View schools and vehicle locations on a live map using **Leaflet.js** with **Mapbox** tiles.
- Highlight school locations with markers and allow dynamic zoom functionality.

### **3. Vehicle Tracking**
- Track real-time vehicle locations (future feature).

### **4. RESTful API**
- Full CRUD operations for managing school data via APIs.
- GeoJSON integration for geospatial data.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**:
  - Python 3.10
  - Django 4.x
  - Django REST Framework
  - MongoEngine
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB (Atlas for cloud-hosted database)
- **Frontend**:
  - Leaflet.js
  - Mapbox tiles
- **Geospatial**:
  - GeoJSON for storing location data.

---

## **Installation and Setup**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Python 3.10+
- MongoDB (Atlas recommended or a local MongoDB instance)
- Node.js and npm (for additional front-end dependencies if needed)

### **2. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iotron-busify.git
cd iotron-busify
```

### **3. Set Up the Virtual Environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### **4. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **5. Configure MongoDB**
- Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster or use a local instance.
- Update `settings.py` with your MongoDB connection details:
  ```python
  from mongoengine import connect
  connect(
      db='Iotron',
      host='mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority',
      username='your_username',
      password='your_password',
      authentication_source='admin',
      authentication_mechanism='SCRAM-SHA-1'
  )
  ```

### **6. Run Migrations**
If using `djongo` for MongoDB integration:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Start the Development Server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### **2. API Endpoints**
#### **List Schools**
**GET** `/api/schools/`  
Fetch all partner schools.

#### **Create School**
**POST** `/api/schools/`  
Example payload:
```json
{
    "name": "Dreamers Academy",
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [-1.2811, 36.8064]
    },
    "address": "Nairobi"
}
```

---

## **Map Integration**

The map is powered by **Leaflet.js** with **Mapbox Satellite Streets**. On loading the application:
1. **Initial View**:
   - Displays Nairobi County with partner schools marked on the map.
2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Fetches school data from `/api/schools/` and plots them as markers.
3. **Interactive Sidebar**:
   - Click a school name to zoom in on its location.

### **Custom School Icon**
- Marker icons for schools are customizable using the `school-icon.png` located in `/static`.
